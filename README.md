# Spike Desktop App - based on ElectronJS

This is a simple ElectronJS wrap for Spike WebApp, my email app of choice.
They do not have a Linux Desktop yet so I created one. 

## Install

TBD...

## Run from code

You need NodeJS to run this. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rauldipeas/spike-desktop
cd spike-desktop
npm install
npm start
```

And optionally make a deb file on `./dist` folder to install on _Debian/Ubuntu_.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Thanks

To the [Spike](https://www.spikenow.com) team, as they deliver an amazing product.
To the [Electron](https://electronjs.org) team. This wrap for the Spike WebApp has been created in minutes just forking the official [Electron Quickstart](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).
